There are coat racks to hang your coat on, in fact all that 
is missing is a butler. Further down the hall you see through
a foyer a set of stairs. There are doors to the west and east
of you as well as the foyer to the north. What door do you 
want to go through?"""

every step causing the floorboards to creek. You pause after 
every step but don't hear anything else moving in the house. 
At the end of the hall is a dooway. Do you go through that 
door(w) or head back the way you came(e)?"""

ballroom="""This beautifully decorated ballroom is dusty and 
looks unused. As you reach the center of the room you hear a

door do you want to go through?"""

 one wall. """

gloom. The wooden steps are covered in a plus blood red carpet and the 
banisters seem to be carvings of human beings in various states of 
decay. The bottom steps seems to be in good health and they get more 
decomposed as the steps go up. Take the stairs?"""

graveyard="""The family graveyard. Most of the tombstones appear to 
be in good condition though the oldest ones seem to be a liitle 
chipped. upon closer inspection you notice that one of the graves looks 
recently filled. You can't make out the name on the coffin but the dates 
on the tombstone are 1786 to 1920, which seems impossible."""

other rooms you have been in seeme to have any fire damage but everything 
in this room shows some sign of being in a fire. There is no fire place 
in this room so the fire had to have been started here. What could have 
caused such a blaze and contained it so fully. There is a door on every 
wall."""
